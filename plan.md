# Math Skills Testing Application Plan

## Problem Analysis & Purpose
A gamified math practice application targeting students and math enthusiasts who want to improve their arithmetic skills through timed challenges. The app focuses on quick thinking and accuracy under time pressure, making math practice engaging and competitive.

## Core Features
- Random arithmetic question generator (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- 60-second countdown timer
- Real-time score tracking
- Live answer validation
- Global leaderboard
- Standout Feature: "Smart Difficulty Adjustment" using GPT-4o
  - AI analyzes user performance patterns
  - Dynamically adjusts question difficulty
  - Provides personalized tips for improvement

## Technical Architecture
- Frontend: React 19 with TailwindCSS
- Backend: Python FastAPI
- Database: SQLite for MVP
- External Integration: OpenAI GPT-4o for smart difficulty adjustment

## MVP Implementation Strategy
1. Setup project structure and basic React/FastAPI scaffolding
2. Implement core game logic and question generator
3. Add timer and scoring system
4. Create basic UI components and game flow
5. Integrate real-time validation
6. Add leaderboard functionality
7. Implement GPT-4o integration for smart difficulty
8. Polish UI/UX and add animations

## Development Approach
- Use bulk_file_writer for initial setup (2-3 files)
- Switch to str_replace_editor when implementing complex features
- Separate frontend into modular components
- Keep backend routes clean and focused

## UI/UX Focus
- Clean, minimalist design with bold colors
- Smooth transitions between questions
- Clear visual feedback for correct/incorrect answers
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Progress indicators and animations

<Clarification Required>
1. OpenAI API key requirement for GPT-4o integration
2. Difficulty levels range (e.g., elementary to advanced)
3. Types of arithmetic operations to include
4. Maximum digits in numbers for questions
5. Points system clarification (fixed or variable based on difficulty)
